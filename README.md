# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview of Surfs Up

### Purpose

In this analysis I will be extracting temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Surfs Up Results

- The average temperature in June was 75º, while the average temperature in December was 71º. A difference of only 4º.
- The maximum temperature in June was 85º, while the maximum temperature in December was 83º. A difference of only 2º.
- The minimum temperate in June was 64º, while the minimum temperature in December was 56º. A difference of 8º.

## Surfs Up Summary
Overall, the differences in temperatures in June and December in Oahu are not significant. It can be said with confidence that the temperature will not affect surfing or the sale of ice cream, since the temperature is fairly consistent after comparing the data from June and December. I would like to perform additional analysis on the average amount of precipitation for each month, as I would suspect rainfall would affect surfing and the sale of ice cream as well. Lastly, I would also like to examine the months with the maximum amount of precipitation throughout the year.
